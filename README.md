# Twitter Like App With React!

This App is under development - Some features might not be fully done yet. This app is based on a tutorial, and the purpose of following it is to learn a lot about best practise for coding in react with django as backend. The future plan is to extend it further than the tutorial.


This app will be based on the stack of:

- Python 3.7/Django 2.2.15.
- Bootstrap 4 (I will change it to 5*)
- React

* Bootstrap 5 allows us to remove jQuery and use react as js driver! As it has been released I see it as a better solution. It will be updated before continuing.


# Features to be done

There is currently in version 1.0 *BETA* planned **7** features.

### Custom Authentication (E-mail Login)

A users login will be based on e-mail and password alone. Users can edit their credentials as well. Users are extended with a profile model class, that allows for extended information. 

### Tweet Walls

We will have the following walls; **Private**,  **Public**, **Global**, where Global will be the collected wall of followers and your own tweets, and Private and Public is two custom choices, for your own wall.

### Post Tweets

You can post tweets with text and image.

### Delete Tweets 

You can delete your own tweets.

### Edit Tweets

You can edit your own tweets.

### Follow / Unfollow

You  can follow and/or unfollow other users.

### Customisable Profiles
